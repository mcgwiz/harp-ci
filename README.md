harp-test
=========

Messing around with Harp, Travis CI, and GitHub Pages. Specifically, this demonstrates how to use Travis CI to continuously publish a Harp site to GitHub Pages. Harp is useful for templated static sites if you find the Node ecosystem saner than the Ruby ecosystem on which Jekyll relies (given you have no desire to become fluent in Ruby).
